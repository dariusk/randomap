Put your data in a file called data.json, and away you go.

data.json should have the same format as county_pop2010.json: 
a dictionary of county ids mapped to numeric values.

county_pop2010.json is provided so that you can divide your data by county population if desired.

You may wish to edit choropleth.js on the lines marked "NB" to change:
 * number format
 * color scheme
